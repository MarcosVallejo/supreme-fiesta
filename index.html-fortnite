The problem is that most non-gamers have no clue. This year, DreamTeam has created a list of perfect stocking stuffers. You still have time to drop some hints. \n&nbsp;\nDUCO Video Gaming Glasses Blue Light Blocking Glasses, $25\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nRealistically, you should take frequent screen breaks to give your eyes a rest. But if you can&#8217;t tear yourself away, these blue-light-blocking glasses should help deal with eyestrain.\n \nDreamTeam Prime for Apex, Fortnite or CoD. From $4.25\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nGet more out of the games you love to play. Stats. Challenges. LFG. And much more.\n&nbsp;\nRetro Arcade Handheld Gaming System, $24\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nIf introducing a full-sized arcade cabinet into your home is too much, go for a handheld version. This one comes pre-loaded with 200 games. \n&nbsp;\nDualShock 4 Charging Station for PS4, $17\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nBecause nothing sucks more than losing power in the middle of an epic run. Also, organization is cool for adult gamers. And you love our planet!\n&nbsp;\n&#8216;Pac-Man&#8217; Head-to-Head Gaming Table, $500\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThis thing is rad, letting you rest your drinks on a cocktail arcade cabinet while you crush some Pac-Man. Arcade1Up even sells matching stools.\n&nbsp;\nFortnite T-Shirt, $20\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nHigh quality Fortnite inspired T-Shirts by independent artists and designers from around the world.\n&nbsp;\nCopper-Infused Fingerless Compression Gloves, $21\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThese gloves work like compression sleeves that help improve circulation to the affected limbs, reducing inflammation, and providing a gamer with longer-lasting pain relief. The Copper Joint also aids in the more efficient rehabilitation of the efficient joints so you can resume your computer gaming activities.\n&nbsp;\nVideo Games Collection Puzzle, $20\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nPuzzles: the original gaming. A thousand pieces, everyone&#8217;s favorite consoles, and endless nostalgia.\n&nbsp;\nMonopoly: &#8216;Fortnite&#8217; Edition, $17\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nFor those moments that you have to spend away from a glowing rectangle, don&#8217;t miss a beat with this analog version of the Fortnite world. \n&nbsp;\nLEGO &#8216;Overwatch&#8217; Junkrat &amp; Roadhog Building Kit, $50\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nIn a surprising collab, LEGO made some pretty cool Overwatch sets to distract anyone who just rage-quit the actual game.\n&nbsp;\n&#8216;Super Mario Bros.&#8217; Heat-Changing Mug, $13\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nNothing like a Mario coffee mug to make your morning a little brighter.\n&nbsp;\n&#8216;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#8217;s Edition 2019&#8217;, $13\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nSerious about your high scores? Help yourself set some goals and see how you measure up to the most impressive video game records in the world.\n&nbsp;\nSnowball USB Microphone, $68\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nAnother one for the streamers, because the audio quality should be as on point as the visuals. Blue&#8217;s Snowball doesn&#8217;t just look cool; it captures crystal-clear sound. With USB, getting started is as simple as plugging in.\n&nbsp;\nCustom Xbox Controller, $80\n\n&nbsp;\nWith full-color customization, this is a creative way to give your Xbox gamer a one-of-a-kind gift.\n&nbsp;\nKingTop Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, $30\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nYou can choose to present an ordinary keyboard, or you can go full mechanical. And if you do choose the latter, make sure to get the KingTop Mechanical Gaming Keyboard. You&#8217;d be amazed at the backlight effects, utilizing six different colors to provide you with a visual experience to go with the tactile sensations of the fully mechanical keys. Each of the 104 keys on this keyboard has been rigorously tested for strength, durability, and responsiveness, while also ensuring its water resistance.\n&nbsp;\nHAVIT Wired Mouse, $11\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nIt may not have a very remarkable optical sensor that can run in the 16,000s, but its maximum of 3,200 DPI should be enough to provide any player with exceptional gaming experience. Its DPI setting can be adjusted to three other levels with the lowest at 800 DPI. The Havit mouse also comes with breathing LED light effects, including seven circular, LED light effects to set the mood in your game.\n&nbsp;\nAtlantic Gaming Desk, $92\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThe Atlantic gaming desk is a piece of steel furniture that&#8217;s specially built for today&#8217;s modern gamer or even a home office owner. There is a charge station, a monitor stand, game storage rank, game controller hooks, gaming speaker trays, and a whole lot more. \n&nbsp;\nHandheld Retro Game Console Phone Case, $16\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nChances are, the gamer you&#8217;re shopping for has owned a Game Boy at some point in their life. This nostalgia-inducing, Game Boy-inspired case actually has functional buttons and a screen on it for playing video games. Your recipient will be able to play games like Tetris, Pac-Man, and Super Mario Bros. The case will also let you wirelessly charge your phone, and it is powered by a rechargeable battery.\n&nbsp;\nPlaystation Alarm Clock, $30\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nHelp your gamer friend start their adventure off on the right foot with help from this PlayStation alarm clock — because let&#8217;s face it, much as they love reality, they&#8217;d much rather live in a video game 24\u002F7. And this is one step closer to that! It looks just like their DualShock 4 controller, has an easy-to-read backlit display, and is powered by a USB cable.\n&nbsp;\nNintendo Patent Posters (Set of 4 8&#215;10 Unframed Prints), $19\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThis artwork of four patents captures the innovative spirit behind everyone&#8217;s favorite old school Nintendo consoles. The prints will look incredible in any game room. They&#8217;re printed on Fuji Crystal Archive paper, which doesn&#8217;t feel flimsy. \n&nbsp;\nPlayStation VR Starter Pack, $288\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nGot a PS4 but not yet on board with virtual reality? Dive head-first into PSVR with this kit comprising the headset, PS Camera, and a copy of PlayStation VR Worlds. Our tip: pick up a pair of PlayStation Move controllers too, which aren&#8217;t included in this kit.\n \nXbox One X, $365\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThis is the Microsoft equivalent to the PlayStation 4 Pro and offers similar upgrades to performance and picture resolution. It&#8217;s a bigger leap than between Sony&#8217;s two console models though and is currently the most powerful console in the world, which obviously has a big appeal to gamers – although equally obviously it&#8217;s quite expensive.\n \nLogitech Racing Wheel + Pedals, $237\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThe best part about most controllers these days is that they work with their respective console and the PC. And thanks to the PC&#8217;s absolutely massive library of driving and racing games, this Logitech racing wheel and pedals combo can be put to even better use than it would with the Xbox One on its own.\n&nbsp;\nShopping for presents is hard.

You&#8217;ll also be able to play around in the water in new ways, with support for swimming, fishing, and motorboats.\n&nbsp;\nBut one of the coolest changes is something that the game has needed ever since it launched.\n&nbsp;\nThe new map is the biggest change\n&nbsp;\nWhen you drop out of the Battle Bus for the first time, you immediately see that Epic hasn&#8217;t uncovered the names of the new map locations. That&#8217;s an intentional part of Epic&#8217;s new medal system, which exists alongside challenges. It rewards you for completing various in-game activities, like finding and visiting some of the 13 new landmarks dotted around the new island. Some old points of interest — like Retail Row and Salty Springs — have also made the jump, giving players the option of returning to their favorite jump spots.\n&nbsp;\nBoats boats boats\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nThere&#8217;s also now motorboats for zooming around in, giving several new ways to navigate the island. \n&nbsp;\nFewer guns\n&nbsp;\nThere&#8217;s a streamlined arsenal of weaponry this time around, no doubt to keep things simple at the outset of Season 1. Mainstays like the Pickaxe and Assault Rifle remain.\n&nbsp;\nBetter graphics\n&nbsp;\nFortnite Chapter 2 also comes with a visual upgrade, with cleaner and more vivid graphics throughout. Fortnite streamer DrLupo said that &#8220;The graphics genuinely makes it look like a brand new game&#8221;.\n&nbsp;\nLevel cap is gone\n&nbsp;\nOther new additions include the removal of the level cap, meaning those of you at Level 100 can continue earning XP. We&#8217;re not currently sure what the new cap is, but 250 seems like an obvious choice.\n&nbsp;\nShoot health\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nOne incredible addition is a new health bazooka – the Bandage Bazooka, to be exact – revives your fallen squad members, putting friendly fire in a whole new light. There&#8217;s also a new set of emotes for high-fiving or synchronizing dance moves together – meaning you never have to floss alone again.\n&nbsp;\nWays to hide, and things to blow up\n&nbsp;\nIn classic Assassin&#8217;s Creed style, you&#8217;ll even be able to hide in hay bales (or dumpsters), while &#8220;gas tanks and explosive barrels&#8221; will make for some exciting environmental dangers.\n&nbsp;\nAddition of achievements\n&nbsp;\nOne of the other significant changes in Fortnite Chapter 2 is the addition of achievements. There are a total of 52 achievements to unlock, and some of them are a bit more obvious than others.\n&nbsp;\nFor instance, the Double Trouble achievement is unlocked by winning 10 Season 1 Duo matches. However, the &#8220;I&#8217;m Trash&#8221; achievement is unlocked by . . . Well, it says &#8220;Just the worst&#8221; so we&#8217;re not quite sure. Though we suppose we have some matches that almost certainly qualify.\n  \nSome of these are super easy like &#8220;In the Zone,&#8221; which only requires you to land in the starting safe zone. Others are more difficult, like Squad Goals, which requires you to win 100 Season 1 Squad matches or even something like Rise &amp; Grind, which you&#8217;ll only get if you hit level 250 this season.\n&nbsp;\nIn any case, here&#8217;s the full list. You can view the achievements in the Career Tab in-game.\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nIn any case, here&#8217;s the full list. You can view the achievements in the Career Tab in-game:\n&nbsp;\n&#8211; Hide the Pain – Used a Bandage to heal yourself while in the storm.\n&#8211; Pier Fishing – Caught a fish off the Sweaty Sands pier.\n&#8211; Can I speak to a Manager? – Took out your frustrations on 20 Fishstick restaurant decorations.\n&#8211; All You Can Eat Sashimi – Ate all the fish and two plastic lobsters.\n&#8211; Let Yourself Down – Eliminate yourself by fall damage.\n&#8211; Collecting Rust – Harvested 999 Metal in a single match.\n&#8211; I&#8217;m Trash – Just the worst.\n&#8211; In the Zone – Landed inside the starting safe zone.\n&#8211; Who&#8217;s a Good Doggo? – You&#8217;re a good doggo.

Here’s how:\n&nbsp;\nNew Post Algorithm \n&nbsp;\nOur LFG no longer displays posts based on time posted. Although doing that is helpful, it isn’t really what is most important to players who use our LFG feature. The DreamTeam LFG now displays posts based on who is currently online first. After all, that’s what really matters. Players use LFG to find someone to play with at that moment. So, players no longer need to scroll through posts to find the players who are currently online or wait until an offline player replies to a message. Players can connect and start playing sooner. As an added bonus, we’ve also added a spam filter. Say goodbye to pointless posts forever. \n&nbsp;\nFIND PLAYERS\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nQuick Skill Understanding\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nEach post displays the most important piece of information related to a player’s skill: the DreamTeam Rating.
